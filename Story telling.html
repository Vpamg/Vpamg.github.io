        What Causes Volcanic Eruptions and Their Impacts?
      </h2>
      <p class="p-5">
        Volcanic eruptions, distinct from earthquakes, result from the release
        of magma, gas, and ash from beneath the Earth's crust. While volcanic
        activity itself may not always directly cause tsunamis, certain volcanic
        phenomena can lead to the displacement of water and affect nearby
        coastlines.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-center">Underwater Explosions and Lava Entry</h3>
      <p class="p-5">
        During volcanic eruptions, underwater explosions can occur when magma
        interacts with water. This explosive release of gases and steam, along
        with the forceful entry of lava into the sea, may displace water and
        create disturbances. While these events might not always generate
        tsunamis, they can impact the immediate vicinity of the volcanic
        activity.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-center">Collapse of Volcanic Islands and Seamounts</h3>
      <p class="p-5">
        The collapse of volcanic islands or seamounts, whether triggered by
        volcanic activity or other geological factors, can lead to the
        displacement of water. This can result in localized disturbances,
        affecting coastlines near the collapsing landmass. The impact of such
        events is typically more confined compared to widespread tsunamis.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-center">Regional Impact of Volcanic Events</h3>
      <p class="p-5">
        Volcanic activities and their associated effects, unlike seismic events,
        tend to have a more localized impact. The dissipation of disturbances
        caused by volcanic eruptions is usually limited to nearby coastal areas.
        Understanding these regional dynamics is essential for communities
        situated in volcanic regions to enhance preparedness and minimize risks
        associated with volcanic events.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-center">Pacific Ring of Fire and Volcanic Activity</h3>
      <p class="p-5">
        The Pacific Ocean, known as the "Ring of Fire" due to its high seismic
        and volcanic activity, experiences numerous volcanic eruptions. While
        not all volcanic events result in tsunamis, the associated phenomena can
        influence coastal areas in proximity to the volcanic activity.
        Monitoring and understanding these volcanic processes are crucial for
        mitigating risks in regions prone to such events.
      </p>
      <h5 class="text-center">
        In summary, while volcanic activity itself may not always directly lead
        to tsunamis, certain volcanic phenomena can impact nearby coastlines
        through the displacement of water. Awareness and preparedness in
        volcanic regions are essential for minimizing the potential risks
        associated with these events.
